The Spreadsheet plugin allows you to create intelligent, data-driven documents right inside your WYSIWYG editor. This makes it a perfect solution for financial, auditing, engineering, technical and science industries.

## Referencing cells

What makes Spreadsheets special? First class integration with content editing! You can start typing `$` to see completion matches from the Spreadsheets inside your document. Cell references are a living part of your document, which means that editing Spreadsheet cell value updates them in a fly. What's more you don't even need to see Spreadsheet in a long document - fuzzy matching will simplify connecting your Spreadsheet data with the editor content.

## Pasting from Excel and Google Sheets

Moving your tabular data from Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets is as simple as copying and pasting it into the editor. Once you enable automatical tables conversion, Spreadsheets will take care of converting any table to an advanced Spreadsheet instance.

## Inserting Spreadsheet Widget

The spreadsheet {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/widgets/README widget} can be inserted into your editor content with the Spreadsheet Properties dialog opened with the Insert Spreadsheet toolbar button (<img class="inline" src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/spreadsheet-button.png" alt="Insert Spreadsheet toolbar button">). It can also be added through a predefined spreadsheet template when {@link guide/dev/integration/spreadsheets/README#content-templates-plugin-integration using the Content Templates plugin}.

Below you can see a simple 3x3 spreadsheet widget right after being inserted into the WYSIWYG editor.

## Converting Existing Tables

If you already have {@link features/table/README tables} in your content and plan to use the Spreadsheet plugin, there is no need to recreate the entire table from scratch as you may simply convert it to a spreadsheet widget instance:

{@img assets/img/spreadsheet_03.png Spreadsheet plugin converts existing table context menu option.}

## Spreadsheet Structure Manipulation

The Spreadsheet plugin allows for easy data structure manipulation with options such as **Insert row above**, **Insert row below**, **Insert column left**, **Insert column right**, **Remove row** or **Remove column**.

{@img assets/img/spreadsheet_04.png Spreadsheet plugin context menu with rows and columns manipulation options}

## Resizing Rows and Columns

Some data points or observations may contain quite long data which might be inconvenient or even unreadable in narrow rows or columns. To solve this issue, you can resize entire columns and rows.

## Renaming Rows and Columns Headers

It is important to label your data in a clear and understandable way. Spreadsheet plugin allows easy rows and columns headers renaming via a simple dialog:

## Sorting

Sorting is a must to efficiently analyze and present any tabular data, thus the Spreadsheet plugin allows for sorting data based on single or multiple columns:

{@img assets/img/spreadsheet_06.png Spreadsheet plugin widget with multisort.}

To sort by a single column, just click the column header. To use multisort, any column which should be added to sorting should be clicked while the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key is pressed.

## Basic Styles Support

While spreadsheets are mostly about data, their presentation is also very important. {@link features/basicstyles/README Basic styles} like bold, italic or alignment come handy when trying to highlight or make some parts of data or individual spreadsheet cells more visible:

## Advanced Styles Support

Spreadsheets are integrated with [Color Button](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/colorbutton) and [Font](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/font) features allowing to change font family, size, background and text colors.

## Data Types, Formats and Validation

Data is the essence of every spreadsheet or data grid element. The Spreadsheet plugin provides a few data types:

* **Text** &ndash; The default type formatted as a plain text that allows any input.
* **Numeric** &ndash; Reserved for numeric values like accounting records. You can choose one from of the available patterns to format data, like percent, financial, currency, etc.
* **Date** &ndash; Type for presenting dates with a few formats available.
* **Time** &ndash; Time format providing conversion between 12h and 24h format.
* **Password** &ndash; Password type used for masking cell data.

Additionally, each data type has a strict validation so it is clearly visible when something is not right with the data.

## Formulas

Formulas provide support for mathematical expression calculations based on input data. Just type `=` and the rest of the formula, using arithmetic expressions and cell references to customize the output. Supported features:

* Any numbers, negative and positive, as float or integer.
* Arithmetic operations such as: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`, `^`.
* Logical operations such as: `AND()`, `OR()`, `NOT()`, `XOR()`.
* Comparison operations such as: `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `<>`.
* All JavaScript Math constants such as: `PI()`, `E()`, `LN10()`, `LN2()`, `LOG10E()`, `LOG2E()`, `SQRT1_2()`, `SQRT2()`.
* Error handling: `#DIV/0!`, `#ERROR!`, `#VALUE!`, `#REF!`, `#NAME?`, `#N/A`, `#NUM!`.
* String operations such as: `&` (concatenation eq. `=-(2&5)` will return `-25`).
* Relative and absolute cell references such as: `A1`, `$A1`, `A$1`, `$A$1`.
* Built-in variables such as: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`.
* Custom variables.
* Nested functions.
* Dynamic updates.

Refer to the official [Handsontable formulas reference](https://handsontable.com/docs/latest/demo-formula-support.html) for more details.

## Conditional Formatting

Do you need to add some colors to your data? Conditional formatting allows formatting data (any cell, column or entire data grid) based on its content. For example, you can mark cells red when they are empty, make them green when their value is above some threshold or blue if the cell value contains a specific text.

Conditional formatting comes with a dozen of predefined rules. Any number of rules can be set up for each cell, which allows for complex formatting and handling advanced cases. You can even drag and drop conditional formatting rules, changing their priority to easily create features like a color scale. Put your hands on the color scale example in the {@linksdk spreadsheets working Spreadsheets demo}.

{@img assets/img/spreadsheet_10.png Spreadsheet plugin with the Conditional Formatting dialog.}

## Auto Fill in All Directions

Auto fill is a mechanism that allows for easy duplication of content in order to fill empty spreadsheet rows and columns (or both at the same time). The little square (fill handle) in the bottom right-hand corner of the selected cell can be dragged to repeat the values from the cell, just like it can be done in Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

{@img assets/img/spreadsheet_11.png A data grid with the auto fill feature visible.}

## Duplicating Spreadsheet Part with Copy and Paste

Apart from creating new spreadsheet instances from scratch or from templates, it is easy to duplicate a part or an entire existing spreadsheet with a simple copy and paste (using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>).

## Frontend Integration

One of the main features of a WYSIWYG editor is the ability to show the created content in a way that it appears almost identical as during the edition. With the Spreadsheet plugin is it possible to show a regular HTML table with all the styling and colors preserved. Another possibility is to show a fully interactive spreadsheet instance (the same as used during editing) with all styles. The latter option is available thanks to the {@link guide/dev/integration/spreadsheets/README#frontend-layer-integration frontend integration adapter}.

## Spreadsheets Demo

See the {@linksdk spreadsheets working "Creating Data Grids with Spreadsheet Plugin" sample} that showcases the most important features like data styling, sorting, conditional formatting, formulas and more.
