## Integrating CKEditor 4 with JavaScript Frameworks

### Is CKEditor 4 Compatible with Framework XYZ?

Yes. CKEditor 4 is compatible with every JavaScript framework that we have heard of so far. CKEditor 4 is a JavaScript rich text editing component (a pretty complex one but still) and it does not require any uncommon techniques or technologies to be used. Therefore, unless the framework that you use has very not typical limitations, CKEditor 4 is compatible with it.

> How do I use CKEditor 4 with my framework?

While CKEditor 4 is compatible with your framework and initializing it requires a single method call, integrating CKEditor 4 with your framework may require using an existing or writing a new adapter (integration layer) that will communicate your framework with CKEditor 4.

When checking how to integrate CKEditor 4 with your framework you can follow these steps:

1. **Check whether an [official integration](#official-wysiwyg-editor-integrations) exists.**

	There are four official integrations so far: for {@link guide/dev/integration/react/current/README React}, {@link guide/dev/integration/angular/README Angular}, {@link guide/dev/integration/vue/README Vue.js} and {@link guide/dev/integration/jquery/README jQuery}.

2. **If not, search for community-driven integrations.** Most of them are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
3. **If none exists, integrate CKEditor 4 with your framework by yourself and share it with the world!**

### Official WYSIWYG Editor Integrations

There are four official integrations so far:

* **{@link guide/dev/integration/angular/README CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG editor for Angular}**
* **{@link guide/dev/integration/react/current/README CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG editor for React}**
* **{@link guide/dev/integration/vue/README CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG editor for Vue.js}**
* **{@link guide/dev/integration/jquery/README CKEditor 4 WYSIWYG editor for jQuery}**

Refer to their documentation to learn how to use them.

We plan to provide more integrations with time. We would like to [hear your ideas](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues/3114) what we should work on next.

CKEditor 4 is compatible with Electron. Using CKEditor 4 in Electron applications does not require any additional steps.
