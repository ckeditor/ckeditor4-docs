# Bugs and New Features

The following article contains tips about reporting CKEditor issues and proposing new features.

## How Do I Report CKEditor Bugs?

The {@link guide/dev/issues_readme/README Reporting Issues} article contains all the information about reporting CKEditor issues.

## How Do I Request New CKEditor Features?

If you feel there is an interesting feature missing in CKEditor, go to our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/issues) and file a new issue.

Please make sure you read the {@link guide/dev/issues_tracker/README Issues Tracker Site} article beforehand in order to make it easier for the developers to examine the issue. It is also recommended to start from a search at the [CKEditor Add-ons Repository](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/all) to see whether the proposed functionality has not been implemented yet and offered as a plugin, either an official one or a community-provided add-on.

When submitting a new ticket, feel free to attach your code suggestions or patches that can serve as a prototype for the requested feature.

You are also most welcome to propose code changes with pull requests submitted to the official [ckeditor4](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor4/pulls) repository. Do note that your code should meet some minimum requirements for code style or included tests, so please refer to the {@link guide/dev/contributing_code/README Contributing Code} article for more information.
