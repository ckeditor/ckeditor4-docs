# Inserting Code Snippets Using GeSHi

<info-box info=""> This feature was introduced in <strong>CKEditor 4.4</strong>. It is provided through optional plugins that are not included in the CKEditor 4 presets available from the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site and {@link guide/dev/widget_installation/README need to be added to your custom build} with <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">online builder</a>.
</info-box>

The [Code Snippet GeSHi](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippetgeshi) plugin is an extension of the {@link features/codesnippet/README Code Snippet} plugin, which uses the [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) PHP server-side syntax highlighting engine instead of the default, client-side [highlight.js](http://highlightjs.org) library.

## Requirements

* CKEditor 4.4+,
* PHP 4.4+,
* A modern web browser or **IE9+**,
* CKEditor plugin dependencies &mdash; these will be resolved automatically if you follow the recommended online builder installation process.

## Installation

### Back-end Configuration

First of all you need to add both the Code Snippet GeSHi plugin and its dependencies to your CKEditor 4 build and also install the GeSHi library itself.

1. Add the [Code Snippet GeSHi](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/codesnippetgeshi) plugin to your build (as explained in the {@link guide/dev/widget_installation/README Installing Widgets} article). Mind the dependencies &mdash; these will be resolved automatically by [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder).
1. Download the GeSHi library from the Download page at the [GeSHi website](http://qbnz.com/highlighter).
1. Create a `lib` directory next to your `ckeditor` directory.
1. Extract GeSHi files to the chosen location &mdash; for example into the `lib/geshi/` directory.
1. Create a `colorize.php` file (e.g. in the `lib/` directory) and set its content to the following:

    ``` php
    <?php

    if ( function_exists( 'stream_resolve_include_path' ) && stream_resolve_include_path( 'geshi/geshi.php' ) === FALSE ) {
        die( '<pre class="html">Please install the GeSHi library. Refer to plugins/codesnippetgeshi/README.md for more information.' );
    }

    include_once 'geshi/geshi.php';

    $json_string = file_get_contents( 'php://input' );
    $json_object = json_decode( $json_string );

    $geshi = new GeSHi( $json_object->html, $json_object->lang );

    echo $geshi->parse_code();
    ```

    This file will be queried each time the syntax highlighting is needed.

1. At this point you may have a following directory structure:

    ```
    lib/
        geshi/
            <GeSHi directories...>
            geshi.php
        colorize.php
    ckeditor/
        <CKEditor files and directories>
        ckeditor.js
    ```

<info-box hint=""> It is a good practice to place external libraries outside the CKEditor 4 directory as it makes {@link guide/dev/upgrade/README future updates} easier.
</info-box>

### Editor Configuration

Go to your {@link guide/dev/configuration/README CKEditor configuration} and set the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url} option. For example for in-page configuration you can use the following code:

``` js
CKEDITOR.replace( 'editor1', {
    extraPlugins: 'codesnippetgeshi',
    codeSnippetGeshi_url: '../lib/colorize.php'
} );
```

You can find more information about setting configuration in the {@link guide/dev/configuration/README Setting Configuration guide}.

**Note:** The value of the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url} option might also be set to an absolute URL.

### Summary

This tutorial uses the `lib/` directory as an example of organizing the directory structure outside CKEditor 4. Most likely you will want to adjust it to match your needs, but remember to update the path in the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url} configuration option.

You can now open your page with CKEditor 4 and insert some code into its content by using the **Insert code snippet** feature. As long as the {@link features/codesnippetgeshi/README Code Snippet GeSHi} plugin is enabled, it will send Ajax requests to the GeSHi adapter file set in the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url CKEDITOR.config.codeSnippetGeshi_url} configuration option.
