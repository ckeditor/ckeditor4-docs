# Editor Resizing Customization

<info-box info="">
 <p>
 	This feature is provided through the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/resize">Editor Resize</a> plugin that is included in the Standard and Full presets available from the official CKEditor 4 <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site. You can also {@link guide/dev/plugins/README add it to your custom build} with <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">online builder</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 	Width and height manipulation is only supported for {@link guide/dev/framed/README classic editor} and does not work in {@link guide/dev/inline/README inline editor}.

When the Editor Resize plugin is enabled, it adds the resize handle (<span title="Resize">â—¢</span>) at the bottom of the editor user interface and allows users to manually resize the editor window to desired dimensions.

The resize feature is highly customizable. It is possible to define the resizing direction or maximum and minimum editor size after the resize. Additionally, this plugin provides the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.editor.resize CKEDITOR.editor.resize} method which allows for resizing the editor on the fly.

## Disabling Editor Resizing

To prevent the editor from being resized you can use the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.removePlugins CKEDITOR.config.removePlugins} setting to remove the Editor Resize (`resize`) plugin.

	config.removePlugins = 'resize';

You can also disable this feature by setting the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_enabled CKEDITOR.config.resize_enabled} configuration option to `false`.

	config.resize_enabled = false;


## Changing Editor Size on the Fly

Besides defining a {@link features/size/README default size} of the editor window you can also change the size of a CKEditor 4 instance on the fly.

To achieve this, use the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.editor#method-resize editor.resize()} method to define the dimensions of the editor interface, assigning the window a width and height value in pixels or CSS-accepted units.

	// Set editor width to 100% and height to 350px.
	editor.resize( '100%', '350' );

While setting the height value, use the `isContentHeight` parameter to decide whether the value applies to the entire editor interface or just the editing area.

	// The height value now applies to the editing area.
	editor.resize( '100%', '350', true );


## Limiting the Width and Height for CKEditor 4 Resizing

It is also possible to define the minimum and maximum dimensions after resizing to prevent the editor window from becoming too small or too big to handle.

To define the minimum editor dimensions after resizing, specify the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_minWidth CKEDITOR.config.resize_minWidth} and {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_minHeight CKEDITOR.config.resize_minHeight} values in pixels.

```js
config.resize_minWidth = 300;
config.resize_minHeight = 300;
```

To define the maximum editor dimensions after resizing, specify the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_maxWidth CKEDITOR.config.resize_maxWidth} and {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_maxHeight CKEDITOR.config.resize_maxHeight} values in pixels.

```js
config.resize_maxWidth = 800;
config.resize_maxHeight = 600;
```

## Limiting the Resizing Directions

Additionally, you can define the resizing directions in order to have more control over the resulting editor appearance.

By default CKEditor is allowed to only resize vertically. This is achieved thanks to setting the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_dir CKEDITOR.config.resize_dir} configuration option to `'vertical'`

	config.resize_dir = 'vertical';

If you set the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_dir CKEDITOR.config.resize_dir} configuration option to `'horizontal'`, CKEditor 4 window will only be resizable in horizontal dimension.

	config.resize_dir = 'horizontal';

If you want to allow both vertical and horizontal resizing, you need to set the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.resize_dir CKEDITOR.config.resize_dir} configuration option to `'both'`.

	config.resize_dir = 'both';
