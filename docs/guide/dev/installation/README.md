# CKEditor 4 Quick Start Guide

The aim of this article is to get you up and running with CKEditor 4 in two minutes.

## Install from the npm Registry

To install [the official CKEditor 4 npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor4) run:

```
npm install ckeditor4
```

For more detailed information you can check the guide on {@link guide/dev/package_managers/README Installing CKEditor 4 with Package Managers}.

## Download from Official Site

### Download

Visit the official [CKEditor 4 Download](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/) site. For a production site we recommend you choose the default **Standard Package** and click the **Download** button to get the `.zip` installation file. If you want to try out more editor features, you can download the **Full Package** instead.

### Unpacking

Unpack (extract) the downloaded `.zip` archive to the `ckeditor4` directory in the root of your website.

## Using the CDN

Instead of downloading CKEditor 4 to your server and hosting it you can also use the CDN version. Go to the [official CKEditor CDN](http://cdn.ckeditor.com/) page for more details.

## Integrate with Popular Frameworks

### CKEditor 4 Angular Integration

By default it will automatically fetch the latest CKEditor 4 [standard-all preset](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/presets-all) via CDN. Check the {@link guide/dev/integration/angular/README Angular Integration guide} on how it can be changed and how to configure the component to fit you needs.

### CKEditor 4 React Integration

```
npm install ckeditor4-react
```

By default it will automatically fetch the latest CKEditor 4 [standard-all preset](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/presets-all) via CDN. Check the {@link guide/dev/integration/react/current/README React Integration guide} on how it can be changed and how to configure the component to fit you needs.

### CKEditor 4 Vue Integration

## Trying Out

CKEditor 4 comes with a sample that you can check to verify if the installation was successful as well as a few "next steps" ideas and references to further resources.

Open the following page in the browser to see the sample:
`http://<your site="">/ckeditor4/samples/index.html`

When using the npm package open the following:
`http://<your site="">/node_modules/ckeditor4/samples/index.html`

Additionally, you can click the Toolbar Configurator button on the editor sample page to open a handy tool that will let you {@link features/toolbar/README adjust the toolbar} to your needs.

## Adding CKEditor 4 to Your Page

If the sample works correctly, you are ready to build your own site with CKEditor 4 included.

To start, create a simple HTML page with a `<textarea>` element in it. You will then need to do two things:

1. Include the `<script>` element loading CKEditor 4 in your page.
2. Use the {@linkapi CKEDITOR#replace `CKEDITOR.replace()`} method to replace the existing `<textarea>` element with CKEditor 4.

See the following example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>A Simple Page with CKEditor 4</title>
        <!-- Make sure the path to CKEditor is correct. -->
        <script src="../ckeditor.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form>
            <textarea name="editor1" id="editor1" rows="10" cols="80">
                This is my textarea to be replaced with CKEditor 4.
            </textarea>
            <script>
                // Replace the <textarea id="editor1"> with a CKEditor 4
                // instance, using default configuration.
                {@linkapi CKEDITOR.replace CKEDITOR.replace}( 'editor1' );
            </script>
        </form>
    </body>
</html>
```

When you are done, open your test page in the browser.

**Congratulations! You have just installed and used CKEditor 4 on your own page in virtually no time!**

1. Check the {@link guide/dev/configuration/README Setting Configuration} article to see how to adjust the editor to your needs.
