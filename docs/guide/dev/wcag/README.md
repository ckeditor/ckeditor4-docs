# CKEditor WCAG 2.0 Compliance

This article decribes CKEditor 4 compatibility with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) standard.

<br style="clear:both">

## Principle 1: Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. See [reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#perceivable).

## Principle 4: Robust

Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. See [reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#robust).
