# Creating a Simple CKEditor Plugin (Part 1)

The aim of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create a basic CKEditor plugin.

We are going to develop an **abbreviation plugin** that lets the users insert abbreviations
into their documents. The abbreviations will be using the `<abbr>` HTML element and
will be added through a dialog window that is opened after clicking a dedicated
toolbar button.

The plugin will be named **abbr**, just like the name of the corresponding HTML
element that we are going to use in its implementation.

## Plugin Files

Firstly, we will need to create the `abbr` folder inside the `plugins` directory of
the CKEditor installation.

<p class="tip">
	Remember that for CKEditor the name of the plugin folder is important and has to
	be the same as the name of the plugin, otherwise the editor will not be able to
	recognize it.
</p>

Inside the newly created `abbr` folder we are going to place the `plugin.js` file that
will contain the plugin logic. Apart from that, since we will also need a toolbar
icon for our plugin, we are going to add an `icons` folder and subsequently
place the `abbr.png` file inside. Finally, we will create the `dialogs` folder with the
`abbr.js` file, which will store the definition for the dialog we will use in our plugin.

To sum up, we will need the following file structure for our plugin to work:

* `ckeditor root/`
	* `plugins/`
		* `abbr/`
			* `icons/`
				* `abbr.png`
			* `dialogs/`
				* `abbr.js`
			* `plugin.js`

## Plugin Source Code

With the following structure ready, it is time to open the `plugin.js` file in
a text editor and to start creating the source code of the plugin.

	CKEDITOR.plugins.add( 'abbr', {
		icons: 'abbr',
		init: function( editor ) {
			// Plugin logic goes here...
		}
	});

All CKEditor plugins are created by using the CKEDITOR.plugins.add function.
This function should contain the plugin name &mdash; `'abbr'` &mdash; and the plugin logic
placed inside the CKEDITOR.pluginDefinition.init function that is
called upon the initialization of the editor instance.

Additionally, as we are going to define a toolbar button, the `icons` property is set, including the name of the icon file (important: matching the **button name**, in lowercase).

## Creating an Editor Command

We want our plugin to have a dialog window, so we need to define an editor
command that opens a new dialog window. To do this, we will need to use
the {@link CKEDITOR.editor#addCommand editor.addCommand}  function to register the
`abbr` command.

	editor.addCommand( 'abbr', new CKEDITOR.dialogCommand( 'abbrDialog' ) );

This command opens the `abbrDialog` dialog that we are going to define in a moment by using the CKEDITOR.dialogCommand class.


## Creating the Toolbar Button

The plugin dialog window is opened using a toolbar button. To this
end, we need to define a button that will be associated with the
dialog window.

	editor.ui.addButton( 'Abbr', {
		label: 'Insert Abbreviation',
		command: 'abbr',
		toolbar: 'insert'
	});

The above CKEDITOR.ui.addButton function call created a button named `'Abbr'` with the following properties:

 * `label` &ndash; the textual part of the button (if visible) and its tooltip.
 * `command` &ndash; the command to be executed once the button is activated. This is the command we created in the previous step.
 * `toolbar` &ndash; the [toolbar group](#!/guide/dev_toolbar-section-toolbar-groups-configuration) into which the button will be added.

Please note that you can influence the position of the button in the toolbar group by providing an optional index, for example:

	// This could position the button at the beginning of the "insert" group.
	toolbar: 'insert,0'

	// This could position the button at the end of the "insert" group.
	toolbar: 'insert,100'

Note: The exact position depends on the indexes defined by other buttons available in your toolbar, so it may take some experimenting with index values to create a perfect button sequence within a group.

## CKEditor Initialization

It is now time to tell CKEditor to load our plugin. To do so we have to add its name to the
CKEDITOR.config.extraPlugins configuration option:

	config.extraPlugins = 'abbr';

<p class="tip alert">
	Please note that <strong>since CKEditor 4.1 all editor plugins that create content
	should be integrated with <a href="#!/guide/dev_acf">Advanced Content Filter</a>
	(ACF)</strong>.
	<br>

	To follow this guide and at the same time comply with the new CKEditor 4.1 requirements you
	need to either set <code>config.allowedContent = true;</code> in order to disable
	<a href="#!/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter">content filtering</a> or
	<a href="#!/guide/plugin_sdk_integration_with_acf">integrate your plugin with ACF</a>.
	For more information, please refer to the official
	<a href="#!/guide/plugin_sdk_integration_with_acf">Advanced Content Filter integration guide</a>.
</p>

Now load a CKEditor sample page. You should be able to see the new plugin toolbar button in the toolbar. For example:

{@img abbr1PluginLoaded.png Abbreviation plugin has been loaded}

## Plugin Dialog Window

Clicking the button should open the `abbrDialog` dialog window. One interesting aspect of it is that it is possible to define dialogs in separate files which are loaded on demand. In our case, we will tell the editor to load the dialog from the `dialogs/abbr.js` file when the button is clicked. To do so, we need to add the following line to the `init` function:

	CKEDITOR.dialog.add( 'abbrDialog', this.path + 'dialogs/abbr.js' );

In the code above we registered the `abbrDialog` dialog name, telling the editor to load the dialog definition from the `dialog/abbr.js` file out of the plugin installation folder (`this.path`).

### The Dialog Definition

It is time to work on the `dialogs/abbr.js` file itself. First, we will simply repeat the CKEDITOR.dialog.add call, but now we will return the dialog definition to the editor:

	CKEDITOR.dialog.add( 'abbrDialog', function ( editor ) {
		return {
			... The dialog definition comes here ...
		};
	});

Check the CKEDITOR.dialog.definition object documentation for a full reference on editor dialog definition.

In our case we will give the dialog window a name (`'abbrDialog'`) and use the
{@link CKEDITOR.dialog.definition#title title},
{@link CKEDITOR.dialog.definition#minWidth minWidth}, and
{@link CKEDITOR.dialog.definition#minHeight minHeight} parameters to define its
title and minimum dimensions, respectively.

<p class="tip">
	The name selected for the dialog window is the dialog name that appears in the
	<code>addCommand</code> function above.
</p>

### Dialog Window Tabs

The dialog window should also contain some
{@link CKEDITOR.dialog.definition#contents contents}, so we will begin with
adding two tabs along with their labels. Note that by default CKEditor also adds
the standard **OK** and **Cancel** buttons.

In order to create the Abbreviation plugin dialog window along with two tabs,
add the following code in the `dialogs/abbr.js` file below the plugin definition:

	CKEDITOR.dialog.add( 'abbrDialog', function( editor ) {
		return {
			title: 'Abbreviation Properties',
			minWidth: 400,
			minHeight: 200,

			contents: [
				{
					id: 'tab-basic',
					label: 'Basic Settings',
					elements: [
						// UI elements of the first tab	will be defined here.
					]
				},
				{
					id: 'tab-adv',
					label: 'Advanced Settings',
					elements: [
						// UI elements of the second tab will be defined here.
					]
				}
			]
		};
	});

The result of this change can be seen immediately. Click the **Insert Abbreviation**
toolbar button in order to open the newly created **Abbreviation Properties**
dialog window containing two (empty) tabs.

{@img abbr1PluginDialog1.png A plugin dialog window with two tabs added}

### Dialog Window Tabs Elements

User interface elements that can be added to a dialog window tab are defined in
the {@link CKEDITOR.dialog.definition.content#elements elements} parameter, which is an
array of CKEDITOR.dialog.definition.uiElement objects.

The **Basic Settings** tab will contain two mandatory text fields (`type: 'text'`)
with  the abbreviation and its explanation. Since both fields are obligatory, it is
useful to add a simple validation mechanism in order to ensure that the user
fills them.

The **Advanced Settings** tab will contain a single optional text field that allows
the user to assign an ID to the abbreviation element.

The code snippet presented below shows a full definition of the contents of both
plugin tabs.

	contents: [
		{
			id: 'tab-basic',
			label: 'Basic Settings',
			elements: [
				{
					type: 'text',
					id: 'abbr',
					label: 'Abbreviation',
					validate: CKEDITOR.dialog.validate.notEmpty( "Abbreviation field cannot be empty." )
				},
				{
					type: 'text',
					id: 'title',
					label: 'Explanation',
					validate: CKEDITOR.dialog.validate.notEmpty( "Explanation field cannot be empty." )
				}
			]
		},
		{
			id: 'tab-adv',
			label: 'Advanced Settings',
			elements: [
				{
					type: 'text',
					id: 'id',
					label: 'Id'
				}
			]
		}
	]

When you reload the editor instance and open the **Abbreviation Properties** dialog
window, the **Basic Settings** tab will now contain two mandatory text fields.

{@img abbr1PluginDialog2.png Basic Settings tab of the Abbreviation plugin}

The **Advanced Settings** tab only contains a single **Id** text field that can be left empty.

{@img abbr1PluginDialog3.png Advanced Settings tab of the Abbreviation plugin}

## Plugin Behavior

The presentation layer of the plugin is now ready, so we can define the plugin
behavior to actually make it work.

The {@link CKEDITOR.dialog.definition#onOk onOk} method is invoked once the user
accepts the changes introduced in the
dialog window by clicking the **OK** button or pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on the
keyboard. Since the plugin adds a new `<abbr>` element to the DOM tree, we
can use the {@link CKEDITOR.dom.document#createElement createElement} function to
create a new DOM element.

With the new DOM element created, we can now retrieve the values of the
`title` and (optional) `id` fields with the
{@link CKEDITOR.dialog#getValueOf getValueOf} function and pass them to
appropriate `<abbr>` element attributes by using the
{@link CKEDITOR.dom.element#setAttribute setAttribute} function.

Finally, we will pass the text entered into the `abbr` text field as the contents
of the `<abbr>` element by using the
{@link CKEDITOR.dom.element#setText setText} function.

With the contents of the `<abbr>` element ready, we can insert it into the
document at the location of the cursor by using the
{@link CKEDITOR.editor#method-insertElement insertElement} function.

Add the following `onOk` function code to your dialog window definition, below
the code that creates the content of the dialog.

	onOk: function() {
		var dialog = this;
		var abbr = editor.document.createElement( 'abbr' );

		abbr.setAttribute( 'title', dialog.getValueOf( 'tab-basic', 'title' ) );
		abbr.setText( dialog.getValueOf( 'tab-basic', 'abbr' ) );

		var id = dialog.getValueOf( 'tab-adv', 'id' );
		if ( id )
			abbr.setAttribute( 'id', id );

		editor.insertElement( abbr );
	}

<p class="tip">
	Please note that another way to insert HTML code into CKEditor is by using the
	<a href="#!/api/CKEDITOR.editor-method-insertHtml">insertHtml</a> function that adds
	HTML code at the location of the cursor in the document: <code>editor.insertHtml( '&lt;h2>This is a sample header&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a sample paragraph.&lt;/p>' );</code>
</p>

## Full Source Code

The complete content of the `plugin.js` file is as follows:

	CKEDITOR.plugins.add( 'abbr', {
		icons: 'abbr',
		init: function( editor ) {
			editor.addCommand( 'abbr', new CKEDITOR.dialogCommand( 'abbrDialog' ) );
			editor.ui.addButton( 'Abbr', {
			    label: 'Insert Abbreviation',
			    command: 'abbr',
			    toolbar: 'insert'
			});

			CKEDITOR.dialog.add( 'abbrDialog', this.path + 'dialogs/abbr.js' );
		}
	});

This is what we have in the `dialogs/abbr.js` file:

	CKEDITOR.dialog.add( 'abbrDialog', function( editor ) {
		return {
			title: 'Abbreviation Properties',
			minWidth: 400,
			minHeight: 200,
			contents: [
				{
					id: 'tab-basic',
					label: 'Basic Settings',
					elements: [
						{
							type: 'text',
							id: 'abbr',
							label: 'Abbreviation',
							validate: CKEDITOR.dialog.validate.notEmpty( "Abbreviation field cannot be empty." )
						},
						{
							type: 'text',
							id: 'title',
							label: 'Explanation',
							validate: CKEDITOR.dialog.validate.notEmpty( "Explanation field cannot be empty." )
						}
					]
				},
				{
					id: 'tab-adv',
					label: 'Advanced Settings',
					elements: [
						{
							type: 'text',
							id: 'id',
							label: 'Id'
						}
					]
				}
			],
			onOk: function() {
				var dialog = this;

				var abbr = editor.document.createElement( 'abbr' );
				abbr.setAttribute( 'title', dialog.getValueOf( 'tab-basic', 'title' ) );
				abbr.setText( dialog.getValueOf( 'tab-basic', 'abbr' ) );

				var id = dialog.getValueOf( 'tab-adv', 'id' );
				if ( id )
					abbr.setAttribute( 'id', id );

				editor.insertElement( abbr );
			}
		};
	});

	You can also <a href="https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-docs-samples/tree/master/tutorial-abbr-1">download the
	entire plugin folder</a> inluding the icon and the fully commented source code.
</p>

## Working Example

The plugin code is now ready. When you click the **Insert Abbreviation** toolbar
button, the **Abbreviation Properties** dialog window will open. Fill in the
obligatory **Abbreviation** and **Explanation** fields and click the **OK** button.

{@img abbr1WorkingExample1.png Abbreviation added in the dialog window}

The newly added abbreviation will be inserted into the document and will be
displayed using the default styling of your browser. In Firefox, for example,
the abbreviation will be underlined using a dotted line and the explanation
will be displayed in a tooltip.

{@img abbr1WorkingExample2.png Abbreviation added in the dialog window}

## Further Enhancements

The Abbreviation plugin is now able to add a new `<abbr>` element to the document,
but does not make it possible to edit an already existing element. For this
feature along with the context menu support check the
[second part of the tutorial](#!/guide/plugin_sdk_sample_2).
