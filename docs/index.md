# CKEditor 4 Documentation

<info-box hint>
	<strong>CKEditor 4 reaches its End of Life (EOL) in June 2023</strong>. From then on, it will receive no more updates, new features, bug fixes, and most importantly, security patches.
	
	Please refer to the [Migration from CKEditor 4](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/ckeditor4/migration-from-ckeditor-4.html) guide to learn what steps you should take to switch to CKEditor 5.

	If you have an active CKEditor 4 subscription and need help, you can contact [our support team](https://ckeditor.com/contact/). If you are not ready to migrate yet, for a limited time we are offering a paid [Extended Support Model](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/) that will protect you against security vulnerabilities and/or breaking third-party API changes.
