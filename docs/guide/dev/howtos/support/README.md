# Licensing and Support

The following article contains tips about the resources that you can refer to when you need some help with CKEditor 4.

## Long Term Support (LTS)

CKEditor 4 is a stable and mature application, backed by 20 years of our experience working on WYSIWYG editors. The CKEditor 4.x line is under a "Long Term Support" (LTS) programme which means that its development and support is guaranteed until 2023. If you are looking for a proven solution that will be fully supported for years, consider CKEditor 5.

## How Do I Get Support?

If you are having trouble installing, configuring, or integrating CKEditor 4 to your application, there are a few solutions that you can try.

### Documentation

First of all, CKEditor 4 comes with really extensive {@link guide/index documentation} that you should read and {@linkexample index plenty of samples} that you can try out and even download to copy and implement in your own environment.

### Stack Overflow

The ["ckeditor"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor) and ["ckeditor4.x"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor4.x) tags at Stack Overflow are where CKEditor developers and integrators can share their problems and solutions. CKEditor 4 has grown as an Open Source product, thanks to the amazing community of developers and users. The `ckeditor` and `ckeditor4.x` tags at Stack Overflow work in an Open Source way, too, so you are encouraged to not only ask questions, but also answer them and help fellow developers. It will be much appreciated!

### Professional Support Channel

There are times and situations, however, when you are unable to get going by yourself. If this is a case, you will be happy to know that you can [purchase a commercial CKEditor license](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/pricing/) which includes professional assistance directly from CKEditor 4 core developers. The dedicated support channel is available for you and responses to your inquiries come in one business day, or even in the same day. [CKSource](https://cksource.com/), the company behind CKEditor, also offers some Enterprise solutions such as Assistance Package and Custom Development for more advanced needs. [Contact us for more information](https://ckeditor.com/contact/)!
