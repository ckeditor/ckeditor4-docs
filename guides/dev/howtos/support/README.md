# Licensing and Support

The following article contains tips about the resources that you can refer to when you need some help with CKEditor.

## How Do I Get Support?

If you are having trouble installing, configuring, or integrating CKEditor to your application, there are a few solutions that you can try.

### Documentation

First of all, CKEditor comes with really extensive [documentation](#!/guides) that you should read and [plenty of samples](https://sdk.ckeditor.com/) that you can try out and even download to copy and implement in your own environment.

### Stack Overflow

The ["ckeditor" tag at Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor) is the place where CKEditor developers and integrators can share their problems and solutions. CKEditor has grown as an Open Source product, thanks to the amazing community of developers and users. The `ckeditor` tag at Stack Overflow works in an Open Source way, too, so you are encouraged to not only ask questions, but also answer them and help fellow developers. It will be much appreciated!

### Professional Support Channel

There are times and situations, however, when you are unable to get going by yourself. If this is a case, you will be happy to know that [CKEditor Premium](http://cksource.com/ckeditor) includes professional assistance directly from CKEditor core developers. The dedicated support channel is available for you and responses to your inquiries come in one business day, or even in the same day. CKSource, the company behind CKEditor, also offers some [Enterprise Solutions](https://cksource.com/ckeditor/services) such as [Assistance Package](https://cksource.com/ckeditor/services#assistance) and [Custom Development](https://cksource.com/ckeditor/services#custom-development) for more advanced needs!

## How Do I Support the Development of CKEditor?

CKEditor is and has always been an Open Source product. We are proud to be a part of the [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) movement and are happy that we can offer the result of long hours of work and dedicated contribution **completely for free** to everyone who wants to use the editor.

If you also want to support the development of CKEditor, it will be most welcome. Here are a couple of things that you can do:

* [Report bugs](#!/guide/dev_issues_readme) or feature requests on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev/issues).

* [Submit code patches](#!/guide/dev_contributing_code) through pull requests in the [official CKEditor repository](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor-dev).

* Help [localize CKEditor](http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Localization) into your native language and update existing localizations by joining us at the [CKEditor UI Translation Center](https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ckeditor/).

* Create CKEditor plugins with new functionality and publish them in the [CKEditor Add-Ons Repository](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/all).

* Join Stack Overflow and share your knowledge with fellow CKEditor users and developers using the ["ckeditor" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor).

* Buy [CKEditor Premium](http://cksource.com/ckeditor). This will not only let you support the development of new editor features, but it will also give you access to a [dedicated support channel](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/support/) where core CKEditor developers are available to help you solve any issues you might have.

**Thank you for your support and for helping us make CKEditor better every day!**
