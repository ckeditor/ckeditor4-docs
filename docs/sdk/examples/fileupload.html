			<p>
				By default CKEditor 4 does not include a file manager, but it can be easily integrated with an external
				tool thanks to the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/filebrowser">File Browser</a> plugin that
				is available in all official CKEditor 4 distributions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once properly set up through the <code><a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-filebrowserBrowseUrl">config.filebrowserBrowseUrl</a></code>
				and <code><a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-filebrowserUploadUrl">config.filebrowserUploadUrl</a></code>
				configuration settings, all file manager features will automatically become available. This includes
				the Upload tab in the Link or Image Properties dialog windows as well as the Browse Server button.

<h1>Rosetta</h1>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Comet_67P_on_19_September_2014_NavCam_mosaic.jpg"><img alt="Comet 67P" src="assets/comet-67p.jpg" style="float:right; height:239px; width:300px" /></a></p>

<p>Rosetta is a robotic space probe built and launched by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency">European Space Agency</a>. Along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philae_(spacecraft)">Philae</a>, its lander module, Rosetta is performing a detailed study of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/67P/Churyumov%E2%80%93Gerasimenko">comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P)</a>. On 12 November 2014 the mission performed the first soft landing on a comet and returned data from the surface.</p>

<h2>Mission overview</h2>

<p>Rosetta was launched on 2 March 2004 on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5</a> rocket and reached the comet on 6 August 2014, becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It is one of ESA's Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consists of the Rosetta orbiter, which features 12 instruments, and the Philae lander, with nine additional instruments. The Rosetta mission will orbit 67P for 17 months and is designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft is controlled from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Operations_Centre">European Space Operations Centre</a> (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for the operation of the scientific payload, together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, is performed from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Astronomy_Centre">European Space Astronomy Centre</a> (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain. It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.</p>

<p>The probe is named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a>, a stele of Egyptian origin featuring a decree in three scripts. The lander is named after the Philae obelisk, which bears a bilingual Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription. A comparison of its hieroglyphs with those on the Rosetta Stone catalysed the deciphering of the Egyptian writing system. Similarly, it is hoped that these spacecraft will result in better understanding of comets and the early Solar System. In a more direct analogy to its namesake, the Rosetta spacecraft also carries a micro-etched nickel alloy Rosetta disc donated by the Long Now Foundation inscribed with 13,000 pages of text in 1200 languages.</p>

				<strong>Note:</strong> The examples on this page integrate CKEditor 4 with
				<a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/ckfinder/">CKFinder</a>,
				but you are free to implement your own solution thanks to the editor
				<a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_file_browser_api.html">File Browser API</a> or choose
				another existing product. Additionally, file manager integration
				<a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_file_browse_upload.html">can be customized</a>
				thanks to numerous editor configuration features that make it possible to, for example, setup the integration
				for selected dialog windows or customize the file browser window size.
			</p>

			<h2 id="uploading-dropped-and-pasted-images">Uploading Dropped and Pasted Images</h2>

			<p>
				The optional <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/uploadimage">Upload Image</a> plugin enables support for uploading
				images that were dropped or pasted into the editor.
			</p>

			<p class="tip">
				Drag and drop file upload is not supported in Internet Explorer 9 and below.
				Support for pasting images and its fragments varies depending on the browser, operating system and application
				from which the image or its fragment was copied. This is a new feature, so it is likely to change in the future.
			</p>

			<p>
				The sample below uses the Upload Image plugin together with <a href="./image2.html">enhanced images</a>.
				Additional <a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/styles.html#widget-styles">widget styles</a> are
				defined to control image size and alignment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Try pasting or dropping images into the editor below (you can drop multiple files at a time). You can also try
				to paste fragments of images (e.g. copied from an image editing application).
