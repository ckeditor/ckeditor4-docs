# Plugin SDK Introduction

The aim of this SDK is to show you how to create custom CKEditor 4 plugins.

## What is a Plugin?

Plugins are the most important building blocks of CKEditor. They provide all editor features, including user interface rendering, text manipulation, data input and output, etc. They are built on top of the base which is called the **CKEditor Core**, represented by the {@link api/index CKEditor Core API}.

A huge variety of plugins is provided by both the core CKEditor development team and the CKEditor developers community. The [CKEditor Add-on Repository](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addons/plugins/all) is the starting point to find and share them. See the {@link guide/dev/plugins/README Installing Plugins} article for more information about how to add additional plugins to create a custom CKEditor 4 build.
