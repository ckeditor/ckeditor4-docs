# Using Developer Tools Plugin to Customize Dialog Windows

<info-box info="">
 This feature is provided through an optional plugin that is not included in the CKEditor 4 distribution packages available from the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site and {@link guide/dev/plugins/README needs to be added to your custom build} with <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">online builder</a>.
</info-box>

An optional CKEditor 4 plugin called [Developer Tools](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/devtools) displays tooltips with information about editor dialog windows, such as:

* dialog window name,
* dialog window tab name,
* dialog window element ID,
* dialog window element type with a link to an appropriate entry in the {@link api/index CKEditor API}.

This feature is aimed at developers who would like to {@link guide/dev/howtos/dialog_windows/README customize their CKEditor instances} or {@link guide/plugin_sdk/intro/README create their own plugins}. It is only useful in the development phase and makes no sense in a production environment, so do remember to get rid of it before you upload CKEditor 4 to your production server!

<info-box hint="">
 This feature works with all CKEditor 4 dialog windows, including the ones that were created by custom plugins.
</info-box>

## Customization Options

The Developer Tools plugin provides two configuration options:

* {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.devtools_styles CKEDITOR.config.devtools_styles} &ndash; sets the CSS styles applied to the tooltip.
* {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.devtools_textCallback CKEDITOR.config.devtools_textCallback} &ndash; contains a function that returns the text displayed in the tooltip.

## Developer Tools Demo

See the {@linkexample devtools working "Developer Tools" sample} that showcases how easy it can be to get information about editor dialog windows and their elements.
