# Creating Mathematical Formulas with MathJax

<info-box info="">
 This feature was introduced in <strong>CKEditor 4.3</strong>. It is provided through an optional plugin that is not included in the CKEditor 4 presets available from the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/">Download</a> site and {@link guide/dev/widget_installation/README needs to be added to your custom build} with <a href="https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder">online builder</a>. In order to enable the plugin you need to {@link features/mathjax/README#setting-the-path-to-mathjax-library set the path to the MathJax library} first.
</info-box>

The optional [Mathematical Formulas](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/mathjax) plugin allows you to create and modify mathematical equations written in TeX directly in CKEditor 4. TeX content will be automatically replaced by a mathematical formulas widget when you put it in a `<span class="math-tex">` element.

New equations can also be inserted into the editor content by using the **Math** toolbar button and entering TeX code in the plugin dialog window. After you click the **OK** button, a mathematical formulas widget will be inserted into the editor content.

Do note that the equations will be output in plain TeX format with MathJax delimiters, `\(` and `\)`, like in the example below:

``` html
<span class="math-tex">\( \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} \)</span>
```

Equations are inserted as widgets, so they have {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/widgets/README#common-usage-scenarios all advantages of widgets}, i.e. you can **treat the entire equation as one entity** and select, delete, or move it with drag and drop in the editor content area as one unit.

## Setting the Path to MathJax Library

In order to enable the Mathematical Formulas plugin, you need to configure the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.mathJaxLib CKEDITOR.config.mathJaxLib} option and set the path to the MathJax library. This value is empty by default, but you can use the free cdnjs service:

    config.mathJaxLib = '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML';

You can also use a different path, either a local resource or a different web resource. This configuration option accepts a full or an absolute path. For example:

    config.mathJaxLib = 'http:\/\/example.com\/libs\/MathJax.js';

## Displaying on Target Page

In order to display mathematical formulas on a target page, i.e. the page where content produced by CKEditor 4 will be visible, the target page needs to [include the MathJax script](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/). It is advisable to use the same MathJax library version as set in the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.mathJaxLib CKEDITOR.config.mathJaxLib} configuration option. For example for the default setting this would be:

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
```

## Changing Default Class

You can also modify the default class for `<span>` elements that are automatically converted into mathematical formulas widgets. Use the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.mathJaxClass CKEDITOR.config.mathJaxClass} option to provide a custom class. For example this setting:

	config.mathJaxClass = 'equation';

will turn all `<span class="equation">` elements into mathematical formulas widgets, including this one:

``` html
<span class="equation">\( \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} \)</span>
```

## Mathematical Formulas Demo

See the {@linkexample mathjax working "Creating Mathematical Formulas with MathJax" sample} that showcases the Mathematical Formulas plugin with its MathJax widget that supports writing equations in TeX.
