# Disallowed Content

<info-box info="">
	The Disallowed Content feature was introduced in <strong>CKEditor 4.4</strong> as a part of the {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/advanced_content_filter/README Advanced Content Filter} system which was introduced in <strong>CKEditor 4.1</strong>.
</info-box>

The Disallowed Content feature complements the existing Allowed Content feature in that it lets you explicitly blacklist elements that you do not want to have in your CKEditor 4 content. You can use it to limit the features that would otherwise be available in the fully automatic Advanced Content Filter mode.

Disallowed content can be defined in the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.disallowedContent CKEDITOR.config.disallowedContent} setting or may be dynamically added with the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.filter.disallow CKEDITOR.filter.disallow} method. It has a higher priority than content allowed automatically or by the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent} setting, hence it is possible to correct automatic settings or achieve more complex results like "allow all attributes except those starting with `on*`".

<info-box hint="">
	It is not possible to disallow content when the Advanced Content Filter is disabled by setting {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent} to <code>true</code>. A similar solution can be achieved by allowing all HTML elements.
</info-box>

## Disallowed Content Rules

Disallowed content rules are very similar to the {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/advanced_content_filter/allowed_content_rules/README allowed content rules}. They can be specified in two formats ({@link guide/dev/deep_dive/advanced_content_filter/allowed_content_rules/README#string-format string} and {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/advanced_content_filter/allowed_content_rules/README#object-format object}), however, it is not possible to specify required properties (which simply would not make any sense in this case).

When only element names are defined, a rule disallows entire elements (and thus these elements will be removed). When a rule also contains property names, only these properties (attributes, styles, classes) will be removed, not elements (unless some required property was removed).

Best to see it in examples.

1. Disallowing entire elements.

	```js
	config.allowedContent = 'h1 h2 h3 p';
	config.disallowedContent = 'h2 h3';
	// Input:    <h1>Foo</h1><h2>Bar</h2><h3>Bom</h3>
	// Filtered: <h1>Foo</h1><p>Bar</p><p>Bom</p>
	```

2. Disallowing attributes, classes, and styles.

	```js
	config.allowedContent = 'p[*]{*}(foo,bar)';
	config.disallowedContent = 'p[on*](foo)';
	// Input:    <p>Foo</p><p onclick="..." data-foo="1" class="foo bar">Bar</p>
	// Filtered: <p>Foo</p><p data-foo="1" class="bar">Bar</p>
	```

3. Disallowing a required property.

	```js
	config.allowedContent = 'p; img[!src,alt]';
	config.disallowedContent = 'img[src]';
	// Input:    <p><img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/..." alt="..."/></p>
	// Filtered: <p/>
	```

4. Disallowing properties on all elements.

	```js
	config.allowedContent = 'p em{*}';
	config.disallowedContent = '*{font*}';
	// Input:    <p style="color: red; font-size: 12px"><em style="font: 'Arial'">Foo</em></p>
	// Filtered: <p style="color: red"><em>Foo</em></p>
	```

5. Tweaking automatically allowed content.

	```js
	// Enabled plugins: image and table.
	config.disallowedContent = 'img{border*,margin*}; table[border]{*}';
	```

    With this code implemented, open the Image Properties dialog window and see that the Border, HSpace, and VSpace fields were hidden. You can also open the Table dialog window and see that the Border, Width, and Height fields were hidden, too.

## How to Allow Everything Except...

A popular requirement is to allow all HTML features except a few specific ones. In this case setting {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent CKEDITOR.config.allowedContent} to `true` is not a solution, because this completely disables the {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/advanced_content_filter/README Advanced Content Filter}, so {@linkapi CKEDITOR.config.disallowedContent CKEDITOR.config.disallowedContent} will not work either.

Therefore the only solution is to write an allowed content rule allowing all elements. Fortunately, this can be done easily by using the {@link guide/dev/deep_dive/advanced_content_filter/allowed_content_rules/README#object-format object format of allowed content rules} and the {@linkapi CKEDITOR.dtd CKEDITOR.dtd} object.

	config.allowedContent = {
		$1: {
			// Use the ability to specify elements as an object.
			elements: {@linkapi CKEDITOR.dtd CKEDITOR.dtd},
			attributes: true,
			styles: true,
			classes: true
		}
	};
	config.disallowedContent = 'script; *[on*]';

The above code sample will allow everything except for the `<script>` elements and attributes starting from `'on'`.

Please note that enabling all possible HTML will pose **a security threat to your application**. It is recommended to only enable essential HTML that content creators need. Read more about {@link guide/dev/best_practices/README#security best security practices}.
